# Software Analysis SS2022

This repository collects examples from the Software Analysis lecture in
Jupyter notebooks. 

## Installation

PDF Exports of the notebooks will be uploaded to StudIP, and markdown
exports are included in the repository. To run the notebooks on your own you
will need to install [Jupyter](https://jupyter.org/install).

## Contents

### 1: Initial character-based analysis

This chapter describes two very basic analyses of source code at character
level, by splitting source code files into lines: The first analysis is to
count lines of code, and the second on is a basic code clone detection
technique, capable of detecting type 1 clones.

### 2: On the Naturalness of Code: Token-level analysis

This chapter looks at the process of converting source code into token streams, 
and applying different types of analyses on these, such as code clone detection
or code completion based on language models.

### 3: Syntax-based analysis

This chapter considers syntactic information on top of the lexical
information provided by the tokens. That is, it considers what language
constructs the tokens are used in, by looking at the abstract syntax tree.
